## Project Highlights

The current implementation showcases several DevOps best practices:
1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All resources defined in Terraform
2. **Modularity**: Reusable modules for different infrastructure components
3. **Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with layered security controls
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of architecture and decisions
5. **Version Control**: Proper Git workflow with meaningful commits

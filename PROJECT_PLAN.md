# AWS Infrastructure Foundations - Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates foundational AWS infrastructure deployment using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). We'll create a secure, scalable multi-tier architecture that showcases core AWS services and DevOps best practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Design and implement secure AWS architecture
- Master Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Document architecture decisions professionally
- Implement DevOps best practices for infrastructure

## GitHub Repository Structure
- `/terraform` - Terraform configuration files
  - `/modules` - Reusable Terraform modules
  - `/environments` - Environment-specific configurations
- `/docs` - Project documentation and architecture diagrams
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts for infrastructure management
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed architecture decisions

## Schedule

### GitHub Setup & AWS IAM
-  Repository Setup
  - Initialize GitHub repository
  - Create directory structure
  - Set up README template
  - Document project objectives

-  IAM Configuration
  - Implement AWS account setup
  - Create IAM users, groups, and roles
  - Define IAM policies for least privilege
  - Commit IAM configurations as Terraform code

### AWS Networking
- VPC Architecture
  - Design multi-tier VPC architecture
  - Document network design decisions
  - Implement VPC with Terraform
  - Configure subnets, route tables

-  Security Implementation
  - Define security groups
  - Configure NACLs
  - Implement network security best practices

- Connectivity Components
  - Set up Internet and NAT gateways
  - Configure VPC endpoints for AWS services
  - Implement transit gateway (if time permits)

- EC2 Deployment Foundations
  - Create key pairs and instance profiles
  - Define EC2 launch configurations
  - Implement bastion host architecture

### Storage & Advanced Features
-  EC2 Configuration
  - Complete EC2 implementations
  - Configure auto-scaling groups
  - Implement load balancers

- S3 Implementation

- Terraform State Management
  - Implement remote state with S3
  - Configure state locking with DynamoDB
  - Set up Terraform workspaces
Integration & Testing
  - Connect EC2 to S3 securely
  - Test infrastructure deployment
  - Validate security configurations

Project Completion

  - Documentation review
  - Project presentation preparation
  - Plan for Week 2 projects

## Deliverables
1. Complete, deployable AWS infrastructure as Terraform code
2. Comprehensive documentation with architecture diagrams
3. GitHub repository with professional commit history
4. Tested deployment and destruction procedures

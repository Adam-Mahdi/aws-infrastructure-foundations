# AWS Infrastructure Foundations - Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates foundational AWS infrastructure deployment using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). We'll create a secure, scalable multi-tier architecture that showcases core AWS services and DevOps best practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Design and implement secure AWS architecture
- Master Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Document architecture decisions professionally
- Implement DevOps best practices for infrastructure

## GitHub Repository Structure
- `/terraform` - Terraform configuration files
  - `/modules` - Reusable Terraform modules
  - `/environments` - Environment-specific configurations
- `/docs` - Project documentation and architecture diagrams
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts for infrastructure management
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed architecture decisions

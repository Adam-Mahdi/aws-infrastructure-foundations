# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

To set up your GitHub repository and push this project:

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit https://github.com/new

2. **Create a new repository**:
   - Repository name: `aws-infrastructure-foundations`
   - Description: `Multi-tier AWS infrastructure deployment with Terraform focusing on DevOps best practices`
   - Set to Private
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/adamuser/general-adam/aws-infrastructure-foundations
   git remote add origin git@github.com:Adam-Mahdi/aws-infrastructure-foundations.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Verify the repository**:
   - Go to https://github.com/Adam-Mahdi/aws-infrastructure-foundations
   - You should see all your project files and the commit history

Your project is now available on GitHub, and you can continue making changes and pushing them to this repository.

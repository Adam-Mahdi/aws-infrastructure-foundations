# Technical Requirements

## Infrastructure Specifications

### AWS Account Requirements
- AWS Free Tier account
- Admin access for initial setup
- Programmatic access for Terraform

### Network Architecture
- Multi-region VPC (primary: us-east-1)
- CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
- 3-tier architecture:
  - Public subnet (web tier): 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24
  - Private subnet (application tier): 10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24
  - Private subnet (database tier): 10.0.5.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24
- Multi-AZ deployment (2 Availability Zones)
- NAT Gateway in each public subnet
- Internet Gateway for public access

### Security Requirements
- Principle of least privilege for all IAM configurations
- Security Groups restricting traffic:
  - Web tier: HTTP/HTTPS from internet
  - App tier: Custom ports from web tier only
  - DB tier: Database port from app tier only
- Network ACLs as secondary security layer
- No direct SSH access from internet (bastion host required)
- All traffic logging enabled

### Compute Resources
- Bastion host: t2.micro in public subnet
- Web servers: 2x t2.micro in public subnets
- Application servers: 2x t2.micro in app tier
- Load balancer for web tier

### Storage Configuration
- S3 bucket for:
  - Application assets (public read-only)
  - Application logs (private)
  - Terraform state (private)
- Lifecycle policies for log rotation

### Monitoring & Alerts
- CloudWatch Dashboard for infrastructure metrics
- CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network alarms
- SNS topic for critical alerts

## Terraform Requirements

### Provider Configuration
- AWS provider with version pinning
- Multiple environment support (dev, staging, prod)
- Remote state with locking

### Module Structure
- Core modules:
  - Network (VPC, subnets, etc.)
  - Security (IAM, Security Groups)
  - Compute (EC2, Load Balancers)
  - Storage (S3, lifecycle policies)
  - Monitoring (CloudWatch, SNS)

### Code Quality Standards
- All resources must have descriptive tags
- Variables with descriptions and type constraints
- Outputs for critical resource information
- README for each module
- Consistent code formatting

## Implementation Requirements

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- IAM roles and policies
- VPC and networking components
- Security groups and NACLs
- S3 bucket for Terraform state

### Phase 2: Compute & Storage
- EC2 instances
- Load balancers
- S3 buckets for application

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Documentation
- CloudWatch setup
- Alerts configuration
- Complete documentation

## Documentation Requirements
- Architecture diagrams (draw.io or similar)
- Deployment instructions
- Cost estimates
- Security considerations
- Future enhancement opportunities
